| 20230806T11:19:07Z | Current GNN models are mostly homogeneous, exploiting only the relationships between users and items, and oftentimes model interactions using only rating information high in data sparsity. Therefore, we propose a review-enhanced heterogeneous graph neural framework to jointly model ratings and reviews.  | https://github.com/CharlotteZhang13/Review-Enhanced-Heterogeneous-Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Item-Recommendation | 0 | 0|
