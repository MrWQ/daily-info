I got bored and figured I would practice perl and learn a bit about an older language and convert it to python. This is for educational purposes mostly because this exploit being well over a decade old I wouldn%t suspect a large impact by any means from publishing. | https://github.com/ItaIia/PhpMyAdmin | 0 | 0|
