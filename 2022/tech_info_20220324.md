| 20220324T22:46:00Z | To englobe, information coming from sensors over Arduino pass through data processing with the aim of predicting object nature (sharpness, stiffness or texture). The prediction operation exploits models already prepared to predict new data. In our project, data out of Arduino, which composed of 150 samples, proceed over I2C (figure 2) to meet the model reposed in Raspberry Pi card. At this juncture, the predicted information transmitted to the feedback device located in the amputee’s biceps by way of Bluetooth module. A unique combination of components forms the feedback device, including Arduino Nano, a Bluetooth module, a couple of coin type vibration motors and heating gadget that impersonate heat danger. Afterwards, the measured pressure on the fingertips was translated into vibrotactile feedback using vibration motors placed on the subject’s arm. However, thermistor captures temperature variation to warn prosthetic’s user by the means of a heating device. Based on the received sensory feedback and the elicited sensations, the amputee can identify the stiffness, sharpness, texture and warm danger. | https://github.com/Elyes-hb/Sensory-feedback | 0 | 0|

| 20220324T19:40:30Z | During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target%s computers is to create your own customized backdoor.
