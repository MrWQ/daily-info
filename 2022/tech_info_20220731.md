| 20220731T19:27:40Z | Inasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is - with ~ 80 % of cases - one of the most common types of breast cancer. It%s malicious and able to form metastases which makes it especially dangerous. Often a biopsy is done to remove small tissue samples. Then a pathologist has to decide whether a patient has IDC, another type of breast cancer or is healthy. In addition sick cells need to be located to find out how advanced the disease is and which grade should be assigned. This has to be done manually and is a time consuming process. Furthermore the decision depends on the expertise of the pathologist and his or her equipment. Therefor deep learning could be of great help to automatically detect and locate tumor tissue cells and to speed up the process. In order to exploit the full potential one could build a pipeline using massive amounts of tissue image data of various hospitals that were evaluated by different experts. This way one would be able to overcome the dependence on the pathologist which would be especially useful in regions where no experts are available. | https://github.com/AhmedMMahrous/Breast-Cancer-IDC-Deep-Learning | 0 | 0|
