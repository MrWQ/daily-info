| 20220502T01:32:40Z | Cipher is a paid cheat client that attacks servers on fivem by sharing / injecting mallicious code into servers to provide a backdoor for cheaters to remote access servers. It accomplishes this by using exploits found in outdated scripts and also sometimes found packaged in leaked paid resources being distributed online. The Cipher cheat features a web panel which allows downloading, editing, uploading and executing remotely anything the hacker wants since they effectively have remote access to the server provided the server is infected. This github repo was made to provide support for servers which are being attacked by this backdoor and provide steps to removing it. We hope that CFX takes action to ensure that this kind of back door is prevented / stopped. Language translations were generated by DeepL. If you are a customer of Cipher, we suggest getting a refund and removing any traces of it as you are putting yourself at the greatest risk. | https://github.com/K3YOMI/FiveM-Cipher-Documentation | 2 | 0|
