| 20220718T20:33:10Z | CVE-2021-44228 | Remote Code Execution attacks are one of the most frequent methods employed by cybercriminals to compromise susceptible computers. In the previous year, a serious zero-day vulnerability was identified in Log4j, a java program used by developers for debugging and application modification loggings. This is also a significant vulnerability that affects the so-called Ghidra reverse engineering tool. | https://github.com/tharindudh/Log4j-Vulnerability-in-Ghidra-tool-CVE-2021-44228 | |

| 20220718T21:12:12Z | The multi-armed bandit problem provides a fundamental concept for reinforcement learning.  The problem setting is that there are multiple actions that can be taken and the distribution of rewards given the action are unknown.  In this case, uncertainty is at its extreme but we must find the most optimal action to take over the long-run.  The problem constitutes a trade-off between exploration and exploitation when making decisions under uncertainty.  The goal of the project was aimed at programming an agent to find the most optimal action by making decisions based on exploration and exploitation probabilities and ultimately find the best strategy for a basket of test-bed multi-armed bandit problems.   | https://github.com/laz-ai/reinforcement-learning | 0 | 0|

| 20220718T12:53:26Z | We exploit the provincial variability of COVID-19 cases registered in Italy to select the territorial predictors of the pandemic. Absent an established theoretical diffusion model, we apply machine learning to isolate, among 77 potential predictors, those that minimize the out-of-sample prediction error. We first estimate the model considering cumulative cases registered before the containment measures displayed their effects (i.e. at the peak of the epidemic in March 2020), then cases registered between the peak date and when containment measures were relaxed in early June | https://github.com/Dubeyrock/project--1- | 0 | 0| 
| 20220718T12:52:03Z | Humanity has decided to exploit the resources contained in asteroids. In order to do this, the settlers have to build a space station in the asteroid belt. The resources to build a space station would be too expensive to transport there, so the settlers have to mine them from the asteroids.  Players of the game control the settlers. Settlers wander in the asteroid belt with single person spaceships looking for resources. | https://github.com/bunny401/Asteroid-Mining-Game | 0 | 0|
