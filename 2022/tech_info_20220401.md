| 20220401T08:02:13Z | In holiday mode, in requisite plaid flannel pajamas, and a little fuzzy from last night’s Chenin Blanc, I did what countless others did on Boxing Day morning: I reached for a platter of avocado toast with one hand, and my iPhone with the other.  I love my avocado toast light on the loaf and heavy on the green gold with jumbo nuggets of tomato. I shave local farm grown garlic straight up from the cheese grater and adorn with salt, a liberal lemon squeeze, and a few drops of something spicy on top.  The news these days is all gloom and doom and we are sick to death of hearing about COVID, so more often than not, at breakfast I’m scrolling Instagram instead, hunting down either art or food porn and recipes.   I won’t likely change it up next hangover brunch, but if I decide to switch styles, Instagram overflows with #avocadotoast hits. Almost two million, to be precise. Options abound: the pumpernickel with warm egg yolks over guacamole looks particularly delicious. Why, just add orange juice to make it a complete breakfast! There are some with grilled mushrooms and black olives that would go down nice with a Bloody Caesar.  Most of us probably think of “avocado toast” as being a kind of millennial thing, a by-product of vegan cafes and global consciousness. But it was first mentioned in a newspaper- California, of course, way back in 1887.     | https://github.com/kingharlem1/fuzzy-octo-guacamole | 0 | 0|
