| 20230512T15:26:12Z | Trojans generally spread by some form of social engineering; for example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.[6] Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan. | https://github.com/HUGOW04/Trojan | 0 | 0|
